    "\n",
    "2. Second, we will evaluate how the \\# of vaccinations in Scotland changed over time, noting how this also corresponded with seasons of high travel. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Third, we will explore the correlation between vaccination rate and death rate. At first, the correlation seems weak, close to 0, but when we introduce a time lag, we see that there is an increasingly strong negative correlation between vaccinations and deaths with a greater time lag. In other words, the vaccinations don't immediately impact deaths, but when you project out to 2 weeks, 3 weeks, or 3 months past the vaccination date, you can see a notificeable decline in deaths. This makes sense, given that vaccinations are intended to prevent future infections, but will have no impact on existing ones. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. The fourth section will disaggregate the data to observe more trends, including about gender and regional distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "We look at the gendered components of COVID-19, observing that women are overall more likely to be vaccinated than men. This potentially could be tied the fact that many of the fields that required front\\-line workers, including the care industries and nursing and medical professions, are female\\-dominated. If women were more likely to be exposed to COVID\\-19 because of less ability to stay at home, they may have experienced stronger motivations to get vaccinated, which could explain the disparity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In terms of regionality, the main conclusions are that regional distribution of cases varied, with a positive correlation between population density and number of infections; Scots residing in more rural regions were less likely to be infected. \n",

    "This could be explained in part by the fact that women were more likely than men to be frontline workers, and are particularly overrepresented in the health and social care sectors, where spread of the disease would also have been easier because of close contact. For example, 77% of the NHS Scotland workforce are women, and women accounted for about 78% of healthcare workers across Europe in 2019. This overrepresentation of women in frontline roles also contributed to higher COVID-19 infection rates among women compared to men in certain age groups. There were twice as many COVID-19 infections among female health workers in Scotland than male. Because of women's increased exposure to the virus, the perceived importance of getting vaccinated could have been higher, causing this gender disparity in vaccination rates. \n",

A more in-depth analysis of data in Scotland could illuminate details further in support of this idea.
